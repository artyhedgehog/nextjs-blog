I am a software engineer, web developer, and programmer, currently living in Saint Petersburg, Russia with my wife and a little son. My interests range from science to buddhism. I am also interested in productivity techniques, tea, music, and literature.

My top values in people are honesty, rationalism, benevolence. As a developer I prefer to work in team, supporting my colleagues and finding ways to achieve a common goal.

Currently, working as a front-end developer in Wrike.
